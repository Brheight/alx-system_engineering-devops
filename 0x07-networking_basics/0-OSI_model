# OSI Model Overview

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that helps understand the functions of a telecommunication system. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each responsible for specific tasks.

## Layers of the OSI Model

1. **Layer 1 - Physical:**
   - Concerned with the transmission of raw binary data over physical mediums.
   - Examples: Cables, connectors, electrical signals.

2. **Layer 2 - Data Link:**
   - Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes.
   - Examples: MAC addresses, switches.

3. **Layer 3 - Network:**
   - Handles the routing of data between different networks.
   - Examples: IP addresses, routers.

4. **Layer 4 - Transport:**
   - Ensures end-to-end communication and data flow control.
   - Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Layer 5 - Session:**
   - Manages sessions or connections between applications.
   - Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.

6. **Layer 6 - Presentation:**
   - Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression.
   - Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF.

7. **Layer 7 - Application:**
   - Provides a network interface for applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

## Project Focus

In this project, we will particularly focus on two crucial layers of the OSI model:

- **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
  - Understanding and implementation of TCP and UDP.

- **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
  - Understanding and usage of IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

## Conclusion

The OSI model is a valuable framework for comprehending network communication. By understanding each layer's functions, we can design, troubleshoot, and optimize networks effectively.
