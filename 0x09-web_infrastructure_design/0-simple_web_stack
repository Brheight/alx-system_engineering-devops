Server IP: 8.8.8.8
Domain Name: foobar.com
DNS Record: A record for www pointing to 8.8.8.8

Components:

Web Server (Nginx):

Role: Manages incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy for the application server.
Communication: Interacts with the user's computer over HTTP/HTTPS.
Application Server:

Role: Executes application code, processing dynamic content.
Communication: Interacts with the web server using a specified protocol (e.g., FastCGI) or via local sockets.
Application Files (Code Base):

Role: Contains the source code and assets necessary for running the web application.
Location: Stored on the server file system, accessible by the application server.
Database (MySQL):

Role: Stores and manages application data.
Communication: The application server communicates with the database using the MySQL protocol.
Specifics:

What is a Server:

A physical or virtual machine providing services or resources to other computers (clients) over a network.
Role of the Domain Name:

Provides a human-readable way to access the web application instead of using the IP address.
Type of DNS Record www is in www.foobar.com:

A record, directly mapping the www subdomain to the server's IP address.
Role of the Web Server:

Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy for dynamic content.
Role of the Application Server:

Executes application code, processes dynamic content, and communicates with the database.
Role of the Database:

Stores and manages application data, providing a structured way for data storage and retrieval.
Communication with the User's Computer:

Communication occurs over HTTP/HTTPS. The web server handles incoming requests and sends back responses to the user's browser.
Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, leading to unavailability if it fails.
Downtime during Maintenance:

Deploying new code or performing maintenance on the web server requires restarting, causing downtime for users.
Limited Scalability:

The infrastructure may struggle with a significant increase in incoming traffic, lacking scaling options like load balancing or component distribution.
